Fujitsu Futro S920 HDD holder
=============================


Remixed from https://www.printables.com/model/250963-fujitsu-futro-s720-s920-hdd-sdd-25-mount

- Made the plate thinner allowing for more space in the PCIe slot next to the hdd (e.g. for internal power supply).
  This requires screws with head smaller than 7mm x 1.9mm
- Shifted the hdd torwards the mainboard by 4mm to give more space to the case bracket.
